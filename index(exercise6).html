<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p><b>If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?</b></p>
<p>If I could visit anywhere in the world, it would be South Korea. I've grown up listening to Korean pop music, eating
Korean cuisine, and analyzing intricacies of the culture.<br>I think it would be interesting to travel and practice
my language skills as well as look at older architecture. It would be cool to go and see how Korea addresses graphic
design.</p>

<!--Here, I talk about the person I admire. Enjoy!-->
<h2>A person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2>
<p>I admire my mom for her dedication, hard work, and patience. She is always able to forgive without fail but also
approaches life with a fire inside of her. I hope to become a woman like her one day. <br> Another person I admire is Boo Seungkwan,
a South Korean artist. His ambition and determination pushes me to never give up.</p>
